# TWT-Code-Jam
## Generate Jam

The start of the next monthly challenge is coming up in just a couple days, and there is a good chunk of info about how the monthly challenges will now be run to be told.

First, we decided to make it a code jam instead of following the weekly challenge format, the previous challenge was kind of leaning into it but not quite there. Along with it being a code jam there are different rules to go along with it and a different system to handle it.

In case you don't know what a code jam is: people get together in groups or work on their own to make whatever app/program that fits into a theme chosen by the jam hosting team. People then vote on it and the jam hosting team chooses the top however many apps/programs

### Jam Theme: Generate
Example being like maze generator, or a meme generator, music video creator, password maker.

### Jam Rules:
- No plagiarism
- must be written during the 4 coding weeks period
- cannot be pre existing code
- must be submitted before the due date

### Jam Timeline:
You'll have 4 weeks to code and submit what you came up with, then 2 weeks to vote on other submissions.
The deadline for signing up is 1 week into the jam. (aka the coding period)

### Jam Teams:
You can be in a team of up to 6 people if you wish. Only one member of the team has to submit the app/program

### Jam Voting: 
3 votes will be assigned to you as a participant. 
Every vote you donâ€™t use will be deducted from your score 
You cannot vote for yourself

### Jam Submission
You must put your app/program up on github, and submit it as a link to the github repository. Make sure to make the repository public when you submit so other people can see it

Jam starts August 1st, good luck hope to see you out there!
